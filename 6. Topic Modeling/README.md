# What is Topic Modeling ?
### Topic modeling is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to automatically identify and extract meaningful topics or themes from a collection of text documents. The goal of topic modeling is to uncover the underlying structure or patterns within a set of documents without the need for human annotation or supervision. It assumes that each document in the corpus is a mixture of various topics, and the model's task is to probabilistically allocate words in the documents to these topics.

# Topic Modeling Challenges
* Interpretability: Interpreting the topics generated by a topic model can be challenging. While you can see the list of words associated with each topic, giving them meaningful labels often requires human judgment. 
* Topic Number Selection: Determining the optimal number of topics (K) for a given dataset is not straightforward. Setting K too low may result in overly broad topics, while setting it too high may lead to fine-grained topics with little practical significance.
* Multilingual and Cross-lingual Issues: Extending topic modeling to multilingual or cross-lingual settings can be challenging due to language differences and data availability. Specialized models and techniques are required for these cases.
